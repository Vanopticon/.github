# Vanopticon Platform

Vanopticon is a comprehensive suite of Cyber Threat Defense (CTD) tools designed to provide robust, scalable, and secure solutions for modern cybersecurity challenges. The platform is built to work both as an integrated system and as a set of modular tools that can be combined with other industry-standard CTD solutions.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture:** Each tool in Vanopticon can operate independently or as part of the larger platform, enabling flexible deployment and integration.
- **Active & Passive Scanning:** Includes specialized tools such as `huginn` (active scanning) and `muninn` (passive scanning) to cover a wide range of threat detection scenarios.
- **Security & Compliance:** Adheres to best practices including the [OWASP ASVS](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) and [WCAG 2.2 AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/docs/) for accessibility and security.
- **Extensibility:** Designed to integrate with other CTD tools and platforms, supporting interoperability and future expansion.

## Repository Structure

- **Vanopticon:** Main user interface components and orchestration logic.
- **huginn:** Active scanning tool for threat detection.
- **muninn:** Passive scanning tool for monitoring and analysis.
