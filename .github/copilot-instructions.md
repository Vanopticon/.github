# Common Agent Instructions

## Priorities

1. Security
2. Robustness
3. Scalability
4. Performance
5. Maintainability

## Code Requirements

Code must conform to the following standards (as applicable):

- Follow [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/).
- UI elements must conform to [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/docs/).
- Conform to the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/), if applicable.
- Conform to the [OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS)](https://mas.owasp.org/MASVS/), if applicable.
- Respect the `.gitignore` file; do not read or modify files listed in it unless explicitely instructed.
- Do not modify files in the `.github` folder unless explicetly instructed to.
- Other dot folders (e.g. `.analyze`) are used by various tooling and should be ignored.

### Acceptance Criteria

All code must:

- Compile with zero warnings or errors.
    + Future-use code should be appropriately marked to avoid warnings (for example, prefix unused identifiers with `_` in Rust).
    + Remove unused code when it is not required.
- Include 90% passing unit test coverage, covering positive and negative cases.
- Follow secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities.
- Not crash in normal operation. Implement proper error handling and logging.

### Coding Style

- Follow language-specific style guidelines and best practices unless otherwise instructed.
- Conform to the appropriate style configuration(s), e.g., `rustfmt.toml`, `.prettierrc.json`, `.markdownlint.json`, etc.
- Prefer tabs over spaces for indentation when appropriate for the language.
- Write clear, concise, and well-documented code.
- Include comments explaining non-obvious logic.
- Avoid hardcoding information (e.g., API keys, passwords) or configurable values.
- Ensure that libraries used are actively maintained and widely adopted.

## Version Control Guidelines

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Keep commits small and focused.
- Use descriptive branch names that follow project conventions.
- Include relevant issue or ticket numbers in commit messages when applicable.

## Project Structure

- Documentation should be in the `/docs/` folder.
- Design documentation should be in the `/docs/design/` folder.
- The `/docs/design/agents/` folder is reserved for machine agent use.

## Project Overview

Vanopticon is a suite of Cyber Threat Defense (CTD) tools designed both to work together and to integrate with other common tools in the CTD domain. This repository is the `.github` repository for the overall project (as a GitHub organization).

Along side this repository is a `Vanopticon` repository which will hold the user interface components of the platform, `huginn` and `muninn` tools that are, respectively, active and passive scanning tools, and others to be determined.
