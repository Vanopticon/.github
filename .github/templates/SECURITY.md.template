# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

We take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please use one of these channels:

- Use GitHub's security advisory feature: [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/{username}/{repo}/security/advisories/new)
- For critical issues, you can encrypt your report using our [security team's PGP key](https://github.com/{username}.gpg)

Please include the following information in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Any known mitigations
- Any related references or CVEs

### What to Expect

When you submit a vulnerability report, our team will:

1. Confirm receipt within 48 hours
2. Provide a detailed response within 7 days
3. Keep you informed about our progress
4. Credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

> **Note:** Replace `{username}` and `{repo}` in links with your GitHub username and repository name when using this template.

## Scope

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in {repo}, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

### In Scope

- Code injection
- Authentication issues
- Access control issues
- Encryption issues
- Data exposure

### Out of Scope

- Bugs that don't have a security impact
- DOS attacks
- Spam attacks
- Social engineering
- Physical security

## Security Updates

Security patches will be released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed. These updates will be:

1. Released as a new version
2. Documented in the release notes
3. Published as a security advisory on GitHub

## Third-Party Modules

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. If the issue is confirmed, they will be responsible for fixing it and disclosing it to their users.

## Bug Bounty

While we don't offer a paid bug bounty program at this time, we are grateful to the security research community for helping us identify and address vulnerabilities.

## Attribution

We will publicly acknowledge security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to us, unless they wish to remain anonymous.
